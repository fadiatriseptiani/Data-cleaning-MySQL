# Data Cleaning Using MySQL

This project demonstrates how to perform data cleaning using MySQL.The dataset contains company layoff information, including details about location, industry, and funding. The main objective of this project is to clean and prepare the data for further analysis by ensuring consistency, accuracy, and completeness.

**Tools**
MySQL

**Data Understanding**
The dataset contains the following columns:
- company: name of the company
- location: Company's location or headquarters
- industry: industry or business sector
- total_laid_off: total number of employees laid off
- percentage_laid_off: percentage of total employees laid off
- date: date of the layoff event
- country: country where the company operates
- funds_raised_millions: total funds raised by the company (in millions)

**Data Cleaning Steps**
The following steps were performed using MySQL:
- Remove duplicates
  Identified and deleted duplicate records to ensure data accuracy and avoid redundancy
- Standarize data
  Formatted text fields, trim spaces, ensured uniform date formats and standarized industry labels.
- Find null or blank values
  Replaced or removed records with missing data based on context
- Remove unnecessary columns
  Dropped irrelevant columns that did not contribute to the analysis

After cleaning, the dataset became free from duplicates and inconsistent entries, properly formatted, and ready for further analysis or visualization.
